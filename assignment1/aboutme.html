        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal page! My name is Awang Azlan, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Information Technology Management. Alongside my studies, I work as an IT Security Officer, 
		where I focus on monitoring and maintaining the security of IT systems, ensuring the protection of sensitive data, and responding to potential threats. My role involves proactive security
		measures, regular audits, and collaborating with teams to implement robust cybersecurity policies.</p>
		<p>I live in Kuching, a city known for its rich culture and vibrant community. I'm passionate about career development, always striving to enhance my skills in IT security, project management,
		and other emerging technologies. I am eager to expand my knowledge, especially in areas like cybersecurity, cloud computing, and data analytics, as I believe these will shape the future of the tech industry.
        Outside of work and academics, I have a deep love for music. Whether it's listening to tunes or exploring new genres, music is my escape and source of inspiration. I'm also active in sports, as I believe 
		staying fit is essential for maintaining both physical and mental health. Sports help me stay disciplined, focused, and motivated, both in my career and personal life. I'm always looking for new experiences
		to broaden my horizons, both professionally and personally, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead!</p>
